Description  : "2023 was different and extraordinary. What made it different was not the turnover or the material achievement."

2023 was the best year so far. It had its ups and downs, but it was still the most beautiful year. I was wondering what made the difference. It’s not because of the greatest breakthrough but because of what I learned throughout the year. Every year, I would have a prayer list, and the Lord would mercifully fulfill it all. It wasn't anything extraordinary; it was a basic survival list. 2023 started blank and without a list. All it had was, "Lord, teach me to trust you! And know my purpose in you." Guess that was the best decision ever.
The year had its share of ups and downs. But of all the years, this year was about PEACE and JOY. It was so hard to get used to it! It felt like lightheadedness. I was restless, and the devil used to scare me! But the Lord took me through. Now, what made the difference?
“Mindset, perspective, and attitude.”

The year started afresh, learning to lean on the Lord because the entire direction of the journey was off my plan. So I didn’t have a plan except for, "I want to go forward in Christ. I want to establish for His glory." Well! He was faithful to take it forward. Professionally and personally, it turned out very well!!
Of course, it wasn’t easy, and there are quite a few takeaways! As some wise people say, one person's mistake is another's wisdom, so I'm penning it here. ✍️The easier we master this, the sooner life gets at ease. Especially if you have anxiety that’s interfering with your sanity and enjoyment of daily life ✍️

🎮**Controlling  the Control Freak**: No matter how many times Jeff told me I was a control freak, I wouldn’t believe him. Because I never interfered with his freedom. Being a control freak is not just about interfering with others' lives, but also about wanting to control every activity in our life. Well! That doesn’t give space for growth. The less of a control freak  I have a better version of myself . It could be as simple as about my daughter's meals or about applying for funding. Absolutely, it is important to have a plan, routine, and structure, but it’s just as important to know when to let it be.

🤗**Letting Go**: Ouch! That hurts! It’s easier said than done. Letting go of failures and letting go of earlier success is hard. Now, I was fortunate to be on a few international fellowships, which contributed to my disappointments 😪when I would get a rejection mail now. Earlier success should remind us that we are in the Lord’s plan. But it’s not a license to be doubtful when something doesn’t go as desired. Letting go of failure and success helps us to make space for new things in life. Always retain the learning, but not the results.

🎊**Rejection is also success**: One of my greatest breakthroughs was to realize that some of the rejections are our greatest successes. Some of our desires can be short-sighted, but the Lord has our blueprint in front of Him. There are multiple times I have tried to be aggressive about my professional life only to break me. I was short-sighted and mostly trying to satisfy “what would people say” rather than looking at holistic growth.

👫**Trust the Lord’s Plan**: I must say, I was so amused to see how He had everything so amazingly planned. Even down to the smallest detail. For example: Just a small inside story, I was so worked up about  my PhD PDC being delayed by 7 months. Remotely, I wouldn't have considered the blessing arising out of it. Nope! It was a delay. In normal circumstances, it was sufficient to cause a delay in my promotion and interrupt my experience. But to my surprise, that turned out to be an additional 7 months of leverage in opportunities here in The Netherlands, simple as calculating the number of years after PhD. It worked well for me, and I cannot be more grateful for the delay. His timeline is perfect, and we just have to learn to trust His time.

🕰️ **Know that the Lord is at work**: Trust is the hardest. Especially when it's the preparatory stage. That’s the stage of silence and dormancy. The constant fear and uncertainty tagging as a nagging thought like “Am I doing the right thing?”. As the Bible says, "faith - now.” Of course, what kept me through is the word of the Lord through my pastor and my favorite preacher, Joyce Meyer.

🧘🏻 **Focus on Holistic Success**: All of us have five parts - Emotional, Physical, Personal, Professional, and Spiritual. To have success that is sustainable and truly enjoyable, it must cater to all these parts. And that’s what the Lord desires for us. To be emotionally stable, professionally forward, financially stable, spiritually connected, and have a great family. Interestingly, it is all possible in Christ.

🎯**Purpose**: We are taught to do what the world would want us to do. But that’s not always the way. We all have our purpose and desire.

🤦🏼‍♀️**Changing “what will people say**” to what does the Lord want me to be. And He wants us to have peace and joy in Him. Let no one steal that or let the worry of “future” take it. The future is for the Lord, and it’s for Him to keep us. I have become bolder and stronger to say “NO,” or say, “Thanks, but no thanks,” “Nope, it doesn’t work for me,” “I disagree with you, but happy for you.”

📈And all of this wasn’t overnight.
Knowing that the Lord has my hairs also numbered! So everything in my life is super planned, and I have to trust Him and move forward.
What may look insane to our naked eyes is what is worthwhile to the Lord.

🕊️Though some of the closest ones went to be with the Lord, He showed His unfailing and unconditional love.
Three most nearly impossible things happened this year, making me revive my belief in the supernatural:
👒_Had the Fangirl Moment_: Met someone really close to heart and had the most amazing time! (The game changer)
🐶Chocu _joined_ us in NL! (Looked like it was taking forever)


🚘I can drive (This was on the “Never going to happen” list)
👩‍💻I am working on GitHub and doing my blog on Mark Down (This is a miracle)

2024 Just Has One Thing:
“I am here, Lord, use me for your kingdom.”
So, have a great year!!! 🥳🥳🥳🎉🎁🎻
