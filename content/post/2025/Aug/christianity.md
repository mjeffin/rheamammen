Description  : If the LORD didnt create  sects, If bible did not mention sects, if Jesus did not speak of sects, who created it? Why are people naive to question it and insecure to listen to the word on the salvation or hear about "born again"?

**For those manipulating Christianity - this is for you!**

**Christianity is not a religion but a relationship with Christ** ! For that basic fact


Where does it say about the different sects of Christianity in the Bible? This has been a very fundamental question I have had for ages, even before I was saved and became a born-again Christian.

Psalm 133:1

*Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!*

Now two words that could be confusing - ‚Äúsaved‚Äù & ‚Äúborn again‚Äù which we will reserve for the second part of the blog.

I was born into a Christian background identified as Marthomites and a well-enough community. Fortunately I wasn‚Äôt exposed to a lot of confusion between sects during my early days, but at the age of 17, I was exposed to Christ and through my personal experience, I took the decision to be a born-again Christian - this was very personal and self-made. From then I have had a desire to share the good news in the gospel.

Especially now, I have met some fantastic people with such similar levels of passion and excitement who have worked in the field with such zeal. But with that came some questions and potential warning as my hubby says - it can be misread as a way to ‚Äúconvert people to Pentecost.‚Äù Very, very unfortunate, because I just don‚Äôt get it.

For starters, I don‚Äôt agree with any denomination be it Marthomite, Catholic, Jacobite, Orthodox, or even Pentecost, because the Lord never had any of these things. In fact, Acts 2, the day of Pentecost is the first celebration when the Holy Spirit filled people. It wasn‚Äôt a denomination, but the experience of having the Lord with us as our forever counselor and help!

If a church cannot teach and guide us to Christ, help us establish the individual relationship, expose to the bible, clarify doubts from it, space for individual thinking, lack of exposure the power of holysprit, sharing the second coming of Christ - that is questionable.

Now I have heard that it hasn‚Äôt gone well with everyone when these passions are institutionalized. That‚Äôs very unfortunate and I don‚Äôt agree to that, because the fundamental of Christian faith that the Lord spoke was of free will!

I can share a very bitter experience - at the time of my wedding, the Catholic Church demanded that I take membership in that church and learn their prayers. I do acknowledge that as an institution, if I want to avail their facility, it makes sense to do it, but if I don‚Äôt believe in it or want to use their facility, then why should I? Now where is the pressure? The pressure is the subtle implication of how my partner( most importantly his family ) would have been impacted for marrying ‚Äúoutside‚Äù their the so called ‚Äúchurch ‚Äú ( mind you this was 10 years back). Which I strongly believe based on the bible to be against fundamental Christian faith . Sorry, but I hated every bit of it. And it‚Äôs questioned my identity or belief system, that I disapprove.

Well, I don‚Äôt disagree about the prominence for logistics in case of some life events - death, funeral etc. But the point is the denial of choice. Which is against the fundamental Christian belief. It is against the foundation of ‚Äúunity.‚Äù

Yes, I cannot deny there has been some mishap in the name of spirituality and that cannot be just attributed to ‚ÄúPentecost‚Äù but to other sects as well, which is sad.

Mind you, if you claim to be manipulated, it‚Äôs one‚Äôs inability to distinguish what bible says and others says, that requires involves learning in personal capacity.

Now coming back to being ‚Äúsaved‚Äù and being born again -

No one learns to sin, and by birth it‚Äôs in the default mode. We are taught to differentiate it over time and as we grow. As we grow and learn the redemption we have in Christ, the hope in the blood of Jesus, we learn the truth to know that we have a Father in heaven loving us unconditionally.

And when we eventually experience the unexplainable love of Christ, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, then is the point we are born again and establish a true relationship with Christ. And that is Christianity. It‚Äôs not religion but a relationship that you with Christ and the only book of know-how is the Bible. Each of us have to do our due deligence to take our thoughts in prayers and know it from the word. NO ONE  can change your heart but you .

Now that‚Äôs a very personal and individual choice, and way of life. Well! I will share the good news no matter what. The borderline is when it gets imposing on the other, which is an absolute no. As a Christian, one think I know for sure is to respect ones space. And I expect it back. I won‚Äôt rub it on your face, neither should you on me!! Duh

So sum up:

I am not a Marthomite, Catholic or even Pentecost. I am a born-again Christian, saved by His grace and living in His mercy. Just a plain Christian because of His relationship. And when I share the gospel, it‚Äôs simple - I am sharing the good news I have experienced and would like everyone to know. I care about each of you , as Lord gives the burden and there is nothing in it¬† for me except joy to see the good news flow . And of course the struggle of investing time and energy in praying for you.

Now what each one does with it is their individual choice!

May the good Lord bless you amazingly..
