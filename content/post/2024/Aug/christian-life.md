Description  : "Being able to chose is true freedom. It can be internal or external strongholds, but take sometime to decide "would you still do it if..." and that includes in our believes as well! "

Religion, spirituality, belief, and ideologies are very personal. The moment they interfere with choice and become imposing, either for oneself or others, they defeat the purpose and become a pain .
Now, I find my identity in being a Christian, but that’s my choice! and it’s not because I was born into a Christian family. My husband has a different perspective altogether , he used to identify himself as an agnostic ( before kids😜)

Thankfully, my parents had a perfect blend of freedom and prayer.

I am a Christian because of my personal experience with Lord and holyspirit at the age of 17. And being chosen under his grace. It can sound absurd to many, well, that not unexpected..  Interestingly even the Lord gives priority to choices and free will!

Thoug
My initial thought about being a born-again Christian was that it would be smooth sailing from the inside! I was (and still am) fortunate to be part of an excellent and fantastic church.

I was fortunate to meet a few people who were strong spiritually, but I also encountered some who merely “showed” spirituality.

This was dangerous because, initially, it was hard to discern the difference.

Coming back to the struggle of trying to be a perfect Christian and attempting to please the Lord! Earlier said expectation and assumption of a “ perfect Christian “ of utter peace and calmness inside. Blah !!
Simple realisation that it’s all a process ..

The initial years, I was focused on trying to rewire who I was because I saw myself through the eyes of everyone else in the world. You know the “the good girl syndrome”
🤮

Forget about calmness and peace inside—I became a miserable Christian over the years! I was disappointed with myself for not being good enough or doing enough to please the Lord. It became scary to pray or enter the Lord’s presence because of the constant thought, “I have failed Him.”

Thanks to the amazing pastor the Lord placed in my life, his messages helped me to understand the Lord’s love better.

It’s not about the absence of turmoil or worries; it’s about knowing that He loves you despite all of this. 
The process of trusting the Lord blindly is hard, but we will get there. It’s not overnight; it’s out of grace and mercy, not our ability.

The rest and assurance we have in the Lord are not how the world sees it. It’s definitely not laziness. 
The world will try to confuse us, but it’s about replacing stress and slogging with trust. 
The Lord expects us to give what we can; the rest is for Him to do.

Just knowing that we fight from victory and are not in competition with the world is a breakthrough. 
Since it’s contrary to what we see every day and what is tangible, it’s harder to believe. 
That’s where prayer and listening to the Word help.

Even better is realizing that the Lord wired us in a specific way for a reason. 
He doesn’t expect us to change, except in certain cases—and even then, only with His grace. 
This is particularly true when the world finds it hard to handle you. 
Test thy conscious in prayer, and leave the rest to let it be.

So what’s the takeaway?

	1.	Being born again doesn’t mean a lack of challenges, but you have an everlasting team player or support to get you through them.
	2.	Assurance that you don’t have to face challenges alone—you have an everlasting helper.
	3.	Resting in Christ is not laziness; it’s letting go into His hands when every odd is against us.
	4.	Even rejections become blessings because they prevent us from settling for mediocrity and push us toward excellence.
	5.	Waiting is not waiting in anticipation but hoping for the possibility of success.
	6.	Knowing that no matter what, you are loved beyond measure!

Finally focus on Jesus ! Faith , peace, grace , love and every goodness will follow
