Description  : "Each of us have our unique calling and purpose. The greatest success is to identifying it, knowing it and living it! But it is equally important to guard it from those who cannot share it with you"

Four years of online lectures have broadened academia's global reach, making engaging classes a reality. These classes transcended jurisdictional differences, opening avenues for faster and easier knowledge exchange. Yet, the absence of physical student interaction and human eye contact was profoundly felt.

Finally, I've got an opportunity to teach again! Though it was just  few lectures focusing on access to justice and street-lawyering ,  and serving as a "Legal Expert." , it was blissful! Though it might seem trival to some, for me, it's was a beyond words. The opportunity to engage with students at Leiden University College, alongside Judith on Law & Society was an experience beyond words. The way the students reciprocated, the way the lecture was well received and the discussion was all i once desired, but never thought would happen. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

Was I nervous, excited, overwhelmed? I'm not sure; I was simply blank, a release of tension that had accumulated over two years. The bottleneck of academia is no secret here. The logical path might have been to pursue a PhD (Second PhD in my case, which is seldom provided here) to integrate into the system or seek a fully funded research project in an alternative  area.
But, I chose the road less traveled, sticking to my area of expertise and beliefs, convinced it was my calling. 
Every time i was worried about funding, one thing my husband reminded was , "money is a by product of an impact and not the product, especially if you wish to pursue a vision and passion!" {I knew he was smart}

Adding to joy was the fact that , the course i have developed for "Integrated approach to climate change laws" will be offered along with the university soon with selected Institutions in India. Ofcourse, there is a long way to go till everything is settled, but this was a reminder and reassurance of multiple things- most importantly - LORD IS WITH ME AND HIS PURPOSE OVER MY LIFE IS NOT DONE! 

I just wanted to remind you few things! 

Everyone has a unique vision and dream. We are urged to stand firm and stay true to them. Our backgrounds, experiences, and ultimately our visions, purposes, and dreams shape us. While we need money to survive, the pursuit of vision, passion, and dreams goes beyond the mere accumulation of wealth and viewing everything through an "economic value" lens. Recognising the difference between economic value and impactful value, and the importance of the latter, requires a vision that sees beyond the present. Not everyone will agree on these values, but that's natural.

It's crucial to understand and accept that our dreams, visions, and ideologies may not resonate with someone who doesn't share a similar mindset. And that's perfectly fine. The inability to grasp someone's passion isn't wrong; it's simply how diverse our perceptions can be.

However, what's not acceptable is:
üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èExpecting one to change the vision based on opinion.

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èDiscouraging one just because it is beyond comprehension or getting discouraged because ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù is unable to comprehend your vision.

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èDownplaying and mocking another‚Äôs vision!

I used to dislike having to put in twice the effort to explain the concept of "impactful" living over mere survival.

Instead may be try:

‚úçÔ∏èRespect: Acknowledge everyone's differences and respect them.

‚úçÔ∏èDiscernment: You don't need to share your vision with everyone. If you feel it will discourage you and drain your energy, stop. It's akin to casting pearls before swine. Both have their value, just not in each other's company.

‚úçÔ∏èAvoiding constant criticism: We don't always need devil's advocates. Instead of problem identifiers, seek out solution providers. Challenges will arise on any chosen path, but surround yourself with those who can help identify solutions.

Moving forward requires diligence, wisdom and perseverance. And only source of it are , Prayers and the destiny helpers Lord places along the way. This will also require us to  conserve our energy and stay

Despite these challenges, what sustains is the hope and promise in Christ. And he is seeing each one through. I am witnessing it all. 

So, hold on to your calling and purpose. It will pay off!
