As far as my family was concerned, it was completely supernatural! This was not on our life plan list. It was as sudden as migrating in 2 months, with many unsettled elements.
One question that constantly bothered me was , “Why would someone leave their homeland”. To move leaving behind family, community, social life and an established life. This is especially  crazy when moving with kids to a foreign country and forsaking all that is familiar ! It  certainly is not as glamorous as it might seem.The loneliness, lack of a support system and exhaustion are realities that hit you hard. Despite these struggles, many  have chosen to move and stay.


Interestingly, there's still significant movement to Europe despite the high tax rates and standard of living, suggesting that finances are not the primary motivator.
Everything did look absurd , till some of the factors! 

a. Quality of Life: Quality of life isn't about luxurious cars or the size of one's house but how we progress in our everyday lives and the stress incurred to accomplish tasks. Interestingly, opting to cycle, walk, or use public transportation for commuting is much more common here and is said to reduce stress. Quality of life also encompasses the freedom to pursue a passion as a career, ensuring that efforts are translated into visible results. So, we know for a fact it's not just about "status" and symbols of wealth. The system ,structure and pleasantry contributes to easing everyday life!

b. Desire for Respect: Mutual respect for personal space and ideology plays a significant role. As an academic lawyer, this was crucial for me. Although I have been part of respectful organizations, there were times when my career choice was not well received, especially the idea of legal research and its impact, which was not deemed most suitable in India. The academic exposure is mind blowing and can not emphasised enough. "Respect" and "Discipline" is natural around here. It is visible everywhere, on the road, in the stores and everywhere. Just to acknowledge the other person, their work, giving way, being patient on the road, etc is normal. 

c. Sense of Anonymity: There's a certain level of freedom and anonymity in a foreign land that helps one to start afresh on their own terms.

d. Exposure: The level of exposure and options available  is significantly higher. This applies to both children and adults, whether it's retaining a hobby, starting a new career or exploring multiple options. 

e. Impactful Living: Interestingly, financial considerations are less dominant when moving to a European country like The Netherlands (Atleast) due to the high tax rate and cost of living. The relatively small pay disparity means that many choose to live impact-fully rather than "work for pay." (Ofcourse its a choice and cannot generalise) An engineer, doctor, academic, plumber or cleaning wouldn’t have a huge gap and everyone is ensured a basic standard of living , makes it easier to chose the desired than must!

f. Governmental Support: The extensive social security benefits, such as unemployment benefits, child benefits, and pensions, are compelling reasons to move.

g. Happy Kids: The Clique - The education system emphasizes the holistic development of children, fostering their happiness. Seeing my children excited to go to school is an added bonus. They are respected as individuals and the  dedicated space  eases the stress on parents. (atleast parenting is recognisd to be hard)
However, every decision involves trade-offs. Starting from scratch, defining oneself and figuring out a new system of living without a support network is challenging. But for some, certain places are more suitable than others. 


So, it's ultimately about what we want and it's never about one place being better than the other, but it about what suits one over the other!!!
