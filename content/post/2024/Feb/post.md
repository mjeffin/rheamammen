As far my family is concerned, it was completely supernatural! This was not on our life plan list. It was as sudden as migrating in 2 months, with many unsettled elements.
One question that constantly bothered me was , “Why would someone leave their homeland”. It is not that glossy across the borders. To move leaving behind family, community, social life, established life. This is especially  crazy when moving with kids to a foreign country and forsaking all that is familiar is certainly not as glamorous as it might seem.The loneliness, lack of a support system and exhaustion are realities that hit you hard. Despite these struggles, many  have chosen to stay.


Interestingly, there's still significant movement to Europe despite the high tax rates and standard of living, suggesting that finances are not the primary motivator.
Everything did look absurd !

It's not because any one community or society is better or worse; it ultimately depends on one's personality and life decisions. But some factors worth taking into account

a. Quality of Life: Quality of life isn't about luxurious cars or the size of one's house but how we progress in our everyday lives and the stress incurred to accomplish tasks. Interestingly, opting to cycle, walk, or use public transportation for commuting is much more common here and is said to reduce stress. Quality of life also encompasses the freedom to pursue a passion as a career, ensuring that efforts are translated into visible results. So, we know for a fact it's not just about "status" and symbols of wealth.

b. Desire for Respect: Mutual respect for personal space and ideology plays a significant role. As an academic lawyer, this was crucial for me. Although I have been part of respectful organizations, there were times when my career choice was not well received, especially the idea of legal research and its impact, which was not deemed most suitable in India. The academic exposure is mind blowing and can not emphasised enough.

c. Sense of Anonymity: There's a certain level of freedom and anonymity in a foreign land that allows one to start afresh on their own terms.

d. Exposure: The level of exposure and options available in a developed country is significantly higher. This applies to both children and adults, whether it's retaining a hobby, starting a new one, or exploring multiple options.

e. Impactful Living: Interestingly, financial considerations are less dominant when moving to a European country due to the high tax rate and cost of living. The relatively small pay disparity means that many choose to live impact-fully rather than "work for pay." (Ofcourse its one choice) An engineer, doctor, academic, plumber, cleaning wouldn’t have a huge gap and everyone is ensured a basic standard of living , makes it easier to chose the desired than forced!

f. Governmental Support: The extensive social security benefits, such as unemployment benefits, child benefits, and pensions, are compelling reasons to move.

g. Happy Kids: The Clique - The education system emphasizes the holistic development of children, fostering their happiness. Seeing my children excited to go to school is an added bonus.

However, every decision involves trade-offs. Starting from scratch, defining oneself, and figuring out a new system of living without a support network is challenging. But for some, certain places are more suitable than others, thus prompting migration.

So, it's ultimately about what we want and it's never about one place being better than the other, but it about what suits one over the other!!!
